# War
Player vs computer, they continuously draw cards until someone runs out of cards

Both the player and the computer start with 52 card decks with all unique cards.

If both players draw the same card, war ensues and now they must each draw 3 more cards.
Whoever's last card has a greater value is the player who takes all of the cards that are drawn.
